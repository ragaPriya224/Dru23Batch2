TASKS:

1.Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation whose 
real and imaginary parts are entered by user.

2.Write a program to print the area of two rectangles having sides (4,5) and (5,8) respectively by creating a class named 'Rectangle' with a 
method named 'Area' which returns the area and length and breadth passed as parameters to its constructor.


3.Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:

Data members

1 - Name

2 - Age

3 - Phone number

4 - Address

5 - Salary

It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.


4.Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student class, then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of Student class.

5.All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well defined guideline (e.g. minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all banks must follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a saving bank account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set any rates above it.

6. Write a JAVA program to implement bank functionality in the above scenario and demonstrate the dynamic polymorphism concept. Note: Create few classes namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base Class) and few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc). Assume and implement required member variables and functions in each class.
